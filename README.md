# Bulk IPv4 Whois Report

## Purpose

Bulk IPv4 Whois Report is a powerful tool for obtaining information about a large number of IPv4 addresses simultaneously. Instead of performing individual lookups for each IP, a bulk report streamlines the process, providing a consolidated view of ownership, registration, and etc. for many IP addresses at once.

## Prequisitites

### IPinfo.io API

ipwhois.py utilizes IPinfo's public API and service is limited to 1000 requests per day. The limit is shared by everyone within same network using same Public IP Address for requests; see API data differences [here](https://github.com/lev2pr0/ipwhois/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#lite-vs-public-api-differences). I highly recommend utilizing an API Token to avoid limitation by following provided steps below:

1. Sign up for free account at [https://ipinfo.io/signup](https://ipinfo.io/signup); Otherwise, login to your IPinfo account [here](https://ipinfo.io/login)
2. Navigate to `API Token` page

![API_Token_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3226e0e0-bfaf-4489-a184-9d3355ce8226)

4. Copy your account's `Token`

![API_Token_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ac4e942-162a-4c04-a167-637a2aba1e54)

7. Download ipwhois_api.py from this respository
8. Open file in editor and add `Token` to `line two` then Save

![API_Token_3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6534223c-91c3-4b55-96f7-fc9ef7a934da)

**WARNING:** API tokens are sensitive! Keep them secret, don't expose them in code you share or public repositories, and revoke immediately if compromised.

## Parameters

```python
python3 ipwhois.py <File_Path>
```
`<File_Path>` is a required parameter to pull report of IPs for running Bulk IP Whois against using script. If not provided, the script will end with usage instructions `python3 ipwhois.py '<filepath>'`.

**Please Note:** API tokens are used in all demos provided above.

</br>

## NOTES

### Supported

- Python 3.10+
-  Windows 10 and above
-  macOS 14 (Sonoma) and above
-  Stable versions of Linux (unsupported vendor linux distributions experience may vary)

</br>

### Design Logic

- Minimal .py files and condensed code for easier distribution.
- Python Standard Library used only to reduce complex requirements to use.
- .env file is recommended for API Token for personal use. Design choice for ease of use for all; especially in secure environments that block .env files.

</br>

### Lite vs Public API Differences

**Sample IPinfo Lite API Data**
```python
{
  "ip": "8.8.8.8",
  "asn": "AS15169",
  "as_name": "Google LLC",
  "as_domain": "google.com",
  "country_code": "US",
  "country": "United States",
  "continent_code": "NA",
  "continent": "North America"
}
```

**Sample IPinfo Public API Data**
```python
{
  "ip": "8.8.8.8",
  "hostname": "dns.google",
  "city": "Mountain View",
  "region": "California",
  "country": "US",
  "loc": "37.4056,-122.0775",
  "org": "AS15169 Google LLC",
  "postal": "94043",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
  "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth",
  "anycast": true
}
```

</br>

### Disclaimers

- API tokens are sensitive! Keep them secret, don't expose them in code you share or public repositories, and revoke immediately if compromised.
- Always test the script in a non-production environment first.
- Review the script's code and understand its functionality before execution.
- The script may require specific permissions or elevated privileges to run correctly.
- The script's behavior may vary depending on the system configuration and environment.
