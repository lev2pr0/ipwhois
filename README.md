# Bulk IPv4 Whois Report | Work in progress

## Purpose 

Bulk IPv4 Whois Report is a powerful tool for obtaining information about a large number of IPv4 addresses simultaneously. Instead of performing individual lookups for each IP, a bulk report streamlines the process, providing a consolidated view of ownership, registration, and etc. for many IP addresses at once.

## Prequisitites 

### IPinfo.io API

ipwhois.py utilizes IPinfo's public API and service is limited to 1000 requests per day. The limit is shared by everyone within same network using same Public IP Address for requests. I highly recommend utilizing an API Token to avoid limitation by following provided steps below:

1. Sign up for free account at [https://ipinfo.io/signup](https://ipinfo.io/signup); Otherwise, login to your IPinfo account [here](https://ipinfo.io/login)
2. Navigate to `API Token` page 

![API_Token_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3226e0e0-bfaf-4489-a184-9d3355ce8226)

4. Copy your account's `Token`
   
![API_Token_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ac4e942-162a-4c04-a167-637a2aba1e54)
 
7. Download ipwhois_api.py from this respository
8. Open file in editor and add `Token` to `line two` then Save

**WARNING:** API tokens are sensitive! Keep them secret, don't expose them in code you share or public repositories, and revoke immediately if compromised.
